# React Installation Guide

This guide will walk you through the steps to set up a React project from scratch.

## 1. Prerequisites

Before installing React, make sure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (version 18 or higher recommended)

Check your Node version:
```bash

    node -v


```

- **npm** (Node Package Manager) or **yarn**

Check npm version:

```bash

    npm -v


```

## 2. Create a New React Project

The easiest way to create a React app is using **Create React App**.

```bash
    
    npx create-react-app my-app


```

Or using yarn:

```bash

    yarn create react-app YOUR-PROYECT-NAME


```

This will generate a new folder called the name you gave with all the necessary files and dependencies.

## 3. Navigate to Your Project Folder

```bash

    cd YOUR-PROYECT-NAME


```

4. Start the Development Server

```bash

    npm start


```
Or with yarn:
```bash

    yarn start


```

Open your browser at `http://localhost:3000` to see your running React app.
